//             heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: 25
//             But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat,
//             and went his way. 26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought
//             forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. 27 So the servants of the
//             householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good
//             seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? 28 He said unto
//             them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou
//             then that we go and gather them up? 29 But he said, Nay; lest while
//             ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. 30 Let
//             both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I
//             will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and
//             bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my
//             barn.

//             heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field. 25
//             But while his[a] people were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed
//             darnel[b] in the midst of the wheat and went away. 26 So when the
//             wheat[c] sprouted and yielded grain, then the darnel appeared also.
//             27 So the slaves of the master of the house came and[d] said to him,
//             ‘Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it
//             have darnel?’ 28 And he said to them, ‘An enemy has done this!’ So
//             the slaves said to him, ‘Then do you want us to go and[e] gather
//             them?’ 29 But he said, “No, lest when you[f] gather the darnel you
//             uproot the wheat together with it. 30 Let both grow together until
//             the harvest, and at the season of the harvest I will tell the
//             reapers, “First gather the darnel and tie it into bundles to burn
//             them, but gather the wheat into my storehouse.”’ ”
